abstract = {Medical dialog systems have the potential to assist e-medicine in improving access to healthcare services, improving patient treatment quality, and lowering medical expenses. In this research, we describe a knowledge-grounded conversation generation model that demonstrates how large-scale medical information in the form of knowledge graphs can aid in language comprehension and generation in medical dialog systems. Generic responses are often produced by existing generative dialog systems, resulting in monotonous and uninteresting conversations. To solve this problem, we combine various pre-trained language models with a medical knowledge base (UMLS) to generate clinically correct and human-like medical conversations using the recently released MedDialog-EN dataset. The medical-specific knowledge graph contains broadly 3 types of medical-related information, including disease, symptom and laboratory test. We perform reasoning over the retrieved knowledge graph by reading the triples in each graph using MedFact attention, which allows us to use semantic information from the graphs for better response generation. In order to preserve medical information, we employ a policy network, which effectively injects relevant entities associated with each dialog into the response. We also study how transfer learning can significantly improve the performance by utilizing a relatively small corpus, created by extending the recently released CovidDialog dataset, containing the dialogs for diseases that are symptoms of Covid-19. Empirical results on the MedDialog corpus and the extended CovidDialog dataset demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic evaluation and human judgment.}

abstract = {The neural-based interactive dialogue system focuses on engaging and retaining humans in long-lasting conversations. This has been explored for a variety of goal-oriented dialogue domains, such as education, health care, entertainment, sports, and politics. To develop an understanding and awareness of social and cultural norms, and to address specific social skills, we need to invent strategies for building interactive systems that take into account the userâ€™s emotions and relevant-facts in a multi-turn conversation. In this paper, we propose a new neural generative model that combines step-wise co-attention with a self-attention-based transformer network along with an emotion classifier to jointly control emotion and knowledge transfer during response generation. Quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluation results on the benchmark Topical Chat and the CMU_DoG dataset show that the proposed models can generate natural and coherent sentences, capturing essential facts with considerable improvement over emotional content.}
